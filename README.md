# MineSweeper
Simple MineSweeper project I coded in Java in grade 11.

This was a project to recreate the classic game "MineSweeper" from scratch (except for the images) in Java with the use of OOP and recursion.

To run this project drag both folders into the "src" folder of your project in the workspace directory of your Java IDE.
